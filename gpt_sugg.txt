Run it in terminal with curl

bash command
curl -X GET https://localhost:8080



If your server uses HTTP (Spring Boot default unless you enable SSL): bash command
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080



1️⃣ The problem

curl -x GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/software-engineer
The -x flag in curl does not mean “HTTP method” — it actually means proxy server.
So curl thought you were trying to use a proxy called GET and failed.

2️⃣ The fix
For a GET request, you can either:

Default GET (simplest):

curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/software-engineer
Explicit GET:


curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/software-engineer
Here -X (capital X) specifies the HTTP method.

3️⃣ Extra tip
Since your controller returns JSON, you can pretty-print it:

curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/software-engineer | jq
(jq is a JSON formatter, handy for debugging APIs.)



For Windows :
    open git bash
    go to the location where sprin boot is present ( cd "/c/Users/Anurag Singh/Documents/laptop/Spring_boot")
    then to see the DB
    curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/soft_eng


Post method to insert something in db when api is running
    POST API URL
    POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/soft_eng
    Content-Type: application/json

    and then a json object
    {
        "name" : "Flins",
        "position" : "HR"
    }
